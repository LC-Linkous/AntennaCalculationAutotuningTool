# AntennaCAT


(LOGO)

The Antenna Calculation and Autotuning tool (AntennaCAT) is a comprehensive implementation of machine learning to automate, evaluate, and optimize the antenna design process using EM simulation software. It utilizes a combined antenna designer and internal calculator to accelerate the CAD condsturction and EM simulation of several common topologies, while eliminating model disparity for automated data collection.
